# Data-science-and-ML
Above Machine learning topics like Regressions,Decision Tree,KNN,PCA,Cartoonising an Image and SVM are implemented on datasets which are downloaded from kaggle using python.


### Decision Tree:
It is a classification algorithm which provides solutions to the regression problems.<br>
Imported libararies are:<br>
    -pandas<br>
    -numpy<br>
    -matplotlib<br>
    -seaborn<br>
    -Random forest classifier<br>
<br>
### KNN:
K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a supervised ML algorithm which can be used for both classification and regression for predictive problems.<br>
Imported libraries are:<br>
    -Pandas<br>
    -Seaborn<br>
    -KNeighborsClassifier<br>
