# Data-science-and-ML
Above Machine learning topics like Regressions,Decision Tree,KNN,PCA,Cartoonising an Image and SVM are implemented on datasets which are downloaded from kaggle using python.

### Cartooning an Image:
Cartoon Effect is a technique that converts an image into a cartoon by applying a few filters. OpenCV, the module in computer vision provides features for applying cartoon effects on images.
Imported libraries are:<br>
    -numpy<br>
    -matplotlib<br>
    -cv2<br>
<br>

### Decision Tree:
It is a classification algorithm which provides solutions to the regression problems.<br>
Imported libararies are:<br>
    -pandas<br>
    -numpy<br>
    -matplotlib<br>
    -seaborn<br>
    -Random forest classifier<br>
<br>
### KNN:
K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a supervised ML algorithm which can be used for both classification and regression for predictive problems.<br>
Imported libraries are:<br>
    -Pandas<br>
    -Seaborn<br>
    -KNeighborsClassifier<br>
<br>
### Regressions:
Regression is a supervised learning in ML that helps in mapping a predictive relationship between labels and data points.<br>
Imported libraries are:<br>
    -pandas<br>
    -Numpy<br>
    -Logistic Regression<br>
<br>
### SVM:
Support Vector Machine or SVM is one of the Supervised Learning algorithms, which is used for Classification as well as Regression problems.<br>
Imported libraries are:<br>
    -Pandas<br>
    -SVC<br>
    
<br>







### PCA:
 PCA is an unsupervised statistical technique used to examine the inter-relations among a set of variables.PCA is the used in exploratory data analysisand  for predictive models in machine learning. <br>
 Imported libraries are:<br>
    -Pandas<br>
    -Numpy<br>
    -MinMaxscaler
